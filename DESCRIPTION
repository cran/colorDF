Description: Colorful Data Frames in the terminal. The new class does
             change the behaviour of any of the objects, but adds a style
             definition and a print method. Using ANSI escape codes, it
             colors the terminal output of data frames. Some column types
             (such as p-values and identifiers) are automatically
             recognized.
